# power_watchdog

This is an untested design of a WIFI/IOT capable watchdog device. The idea is that it would be connected to your router and it would monitor the health of your network using latency measures / speed check etc and reset your hardware if it falls below a threshold or cannot get the internet at all! Can also operate on a timer.

This is an EAGLE CAD project
